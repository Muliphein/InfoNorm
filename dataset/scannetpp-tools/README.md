## Dataset Documentation
Please refer to the [official dataset documentation](https://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/scannetpp/documentation) which describes the files in the dataset.

The recommended way of accessing individual files and directories is through the  [scene class](common/scene_release.py).

For evaluation and submission, refer to the [submission instructions](https://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/scannetpp/benchmark/docs).

## Requirements
```
conda create -n scannetpp python=3.10
conda activate scannetpp
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## DSLR

### Undistortion: convert fisheye images to pinhole with OpenCV
The official undistortion script that generates the undistortion ground-truth in the benchmark. This will generate the undistorted images, mask, and the respective transforms.json file for NeRF training.

Insert `data_root` in `dslr/configs/undistort.yml` and run:
```
python -m dslr.undistort dslr/configs/undistort.yml
```
Additionally, the user can specify the input and output path in the config files.

### Downscale the DSLR images
If you need to downscale the DSLR images to reduce the memory overhead during NeRF training, you can run the following script. The configuration is similar to the undistortion script.

```
python -m dslr.downscale dslr/configs/downscale.yml

```


### Undistortion: convert fisheye images to pinhole with COLMAP
User could also use COLMAP to undistort DSLR images (and masks) based on COLMAP so that the output images are pinhole camera models. However, **the result here is different from the ones generated by OpenCV**.

You will need [COLMAP](https://colmap.github.io/) installed to run this script.

Insert `data_root` and `output_dir` in `dslr/configs/undistort_colmap.yml` and run:
```
python -m dslr.undistort_colmap dslr/configs/undistort_colmap.yml
```
The output will be saved in `output_dir` with the following structure:
```
output_dir/SCENE_ID
├── colmap
│   ├── cameras.txt
│   ├── images.txt
│   └── points3D.txt
├── images
├── masks
└── nerfstudio/transforms.json
```

### Render Depth for DSLR and iPhone

Install the python package from https://github.com/liu115/renderpy in addtion to the requirements.

```
python -m common.render common/configs/render.yml
```
The output will be saved in `output_dir` with the following structure:
```
output_dir/SCENE_ID/[dslr, iphone]
├── render_rgb
└── render_depth
```
The rendered depth maps are single-channel uint16 png, where the unit is mm and 0 means invalid depth.

### Render Semantics (coming soon)

## iPhone
### Extract RGB frames, masks and depth frames
```
python -m iphone.prepare_iphone_data iphone/configs/prepare_iphone_data.yml
```


## Semantics

### Prepare 3D Semantics Training Data
The meshes may not have a uniform distribution of mesh 
vertices and voxelizing these could lead to holes in the data.
Hence, the vertices must not be treated as a *point cloud*. 

Instead, please sample points on the surface of the mesh and use
these as inputs for voxelization, etc.

An example of how to do this is given. This script samples points on the mesh and maps 1.5k+ raw labels to the benchmark classes. The mapping file is at `metadata/semantic_benchmark/map_benchmark.csv`

Configure the paths in `semantic/configs/prepare_training_data.yml`


Then run
```
python -m semantic.prep.prepare_training_data semantic/configs/prepare_training_data.yml
```

This generated PTH files with labels on the sampled points. 

### Visualize training data

Configure the PTH data dir, scene list and required outputs in `semantic/configs/viz_pth_data.yml`
```
python -m semantic.viz.viz_pth_data semantic/configs/viz_pth_data.yml
```

### Prepare Semantic/Instance Ground Truth Files for Evaluation
Prepare PTH files similar to the training data step, but without point sampling. Then configure the PTH data dir, scene list and required outputs in `semantic/configs/prepare_semantic_gt.yml`
and run 
```
python -m semantic.prep.prepare_semantic_gt semantic/configs/prepare_semantic_gt.yml
```

### 3D Semantic Segmentation Evaluation
For this you need to prepare the semantic ground truth and predictions in the following format
- one file per scene named `<scene_id>.txt`, where each line contains the
label(s) for the corresponding vertex in the mesh. You can specify either a single label
or multiple comma-separate labels in each line. Each line should have the same number of labels, i.e
each file should be an `N x 1` or `N x 3` array for 1 and 3 predictions respectively.

Configure the paths to GT, predictions, label list and downloaded data in `semantic/configs/eval_semantic.yml`

Then run
```
python -m semantic.eval.eval_semantic semantic/configs/eval_semantic.yml
```

### 3D Instance Segmentation Evaluation

See `semantic/eval/eval_instance.py` for details on the input formats.

Configure the paths to GT, predictions, label list and downloaded data in `semantic/configs/eval_instance.yml`

Then run
```
python -m semantic.eval.eval_instance semantic/configs/eval_instance.yml
```

## Novel View Synthesis
### Novel View Synthesis Evaluation (DSLR)
The evaluation script here is the same that runs on the benchmark server. Therefore, it's highly encouraged to run the evaluation script before submitting the results (on the val set) to the benchmark server.


```
python -m eval.nvs --data_root DATA_ROOT --split SPLIT_FILE --pred_dir PRED_DIR
```

The PRED_DIR should have the following structure:
```
SCENE_ID0/
├── DSC00001.JPG
├── DSC00002.JPG
├── ...
SCENE_ID1/
├── ...
```

NOTE:
The evaluation script here is the same that runs on the benchmark server. Therefore, it's highly encouraged to run the evaluation script before submitting the results (on the val set) to the benchmark server.
